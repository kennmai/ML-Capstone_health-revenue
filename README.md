Machine learning has the potential to significantly enhance business decision-making in healthcare. This project involves comprehensive data wrangling, cleaning, and exploratory analysis to uncover key statistical correlations between various factors influencing the revenue of a synthetic medical group. Based on these insights, I developed two distinct and robust machine learning models, decision tree and regression, to predict future revenue with an accuracy margin of 5%.

The analysis yields critical insights and actionable recommendations, including the standardization of data collection methods across locations, the exploration of a web-based application for data integration, and the continued refinement and testing of the superior-performing regression model to optimize future predictive accuracy.
